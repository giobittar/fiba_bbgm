Basketball GM rosters for FIBA national teams.

Go to the releases section (https://github.com/leoisiah/fiba_bbgm/releases/) to download.

Open the "rosters" directory to view the list of JSON files for BBGM (http://play.basketball-gm.com/).

The "code" directory contains a rough code I used to generate these.
